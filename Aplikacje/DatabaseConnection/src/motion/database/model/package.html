This package contains data model classes. They reflect data structures on the server side.

Objects which are instances of these classes are not synchronized automatically with the server
as it is often done in other solutions. They are mostly return by facade query operations and are 
designed to be consumed on the client side. In several cases they are used as facade operations 
parameters.

There are three types of classes:
<ol>
<li>Real entity classes - reflecting database tables. These are: <b>Performer, Session, Trial,
Measurement, MeasurementConfiguration, PerformerConfiguration</b>. 
The base class for all of them is <b>GenericDescription</b>. Also each of them is supported by 
<b>*StaticAttributes</b> class which contains an enumeration of static attributes for the given entity.
The *StaticAttributes classes are used for type checking purposes on the client side and are mostly 
supporting programmers.  
</li>
<li>Virtual entity classes - not reflecting any particular database table but containing data 
in such a way that they seem to be stored on the database side. They are also subclasses of 
<b>GenericDescription</b> and are paired with <b>*StaticAttributes</b> information. In this way objects of these 
classes may be used in exactly the same way as the real entity classes. This kind of uniform
model and transparent integration simplifies the client code and make it more generic.
These classes are: <b>DatabaseFile, GenericResult, SessionGroup, User, UserBasket, UserPrivileges</b></li>
<li>Supporting classes - tools used to organize data on the client side. These classes are:
<b>EntityAttribute, EntityAttributeGroup, Filter, GenericName, MotionKind, Predicate, PredicateComposition, 
Privileges, SessionValidationInfo, SessionPrivileges, SimplePredicate.</b> Please, read detailed description for
them in order to get information on their purposes.</li>
